add some content to the file on github

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
o It is handy for "backing up" my local copy or to make it easy to share with someone else and being able to access from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
o You wouldn't want to lose local changes
