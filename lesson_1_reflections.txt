How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

As a human I make lots of mistakes having a tool to spot differences in code keeps me out of trouble and I do mean big trouble.

Sometimes you forgot that code contains dependencies and so you make a what you think is a minor change and forget about and then when you have a problem you don't think about the "minor" change unit the diff tool points out the difference and this triggers something that makes you remember the old dependency.

Why do some version control systems allow multiple file while other don't?

Git was designed right from the beginning to support SW version control, SW typically has multiple files for a project so supporting multiple files a is fundamental requirement, goggle doc's is designed for reports and presentation which typically one require one document so supporting multiple files is not a fundamental requirement.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
You use log to get an idea of the changes that were made and then use diff to look at the specific changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I would make more confident that any problems caused could be easily fixed.  But I should still be careful and should still check and test changes before checking them in.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to be able to use it to track/save personal python scripts i write
