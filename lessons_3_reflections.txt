When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
o I maybe on someone elses computer

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
o You can work on the most recent version of the code even if you don't have network connection


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
o When you don't want to mess up the master.
o When merge in changes to the master and you want to make a pull request
